    "### Installation\n",
    "Scikit-learn is included with the [Anaconda distribution of Pyhton](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Current stable version is 0.19.2. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should therefore have it in  your systems. If you want to install it separetely in your own machine, you can find the installation and all other details in their [webpage](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.3),\n",
    "* NumPy (>= 1.8.2),\n",
    "* SciPy (>= 0.13.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation is easily performed with the `pip` or `conda` commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -U scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "`Scikit-learn` is the main `python` machine learning library. It consists of many learners which can learn models from data, as well as a lot of utility functions such as `train_test_split`. It can be used in `python` by the incantation `import sklearn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library has a very well-defined interface. This makes the library a joy to use, and surely contributes to its popularity.  The API consists of three interfaces:\n",
    "1. estimator interface: builds and fits models\n",
    "   * This interface is at the core of the library\n",
    "   * Provides the `fit()` method\n",
    "   * Unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms can be accessed from the estimator interface\n",
    "2. predictor interface: makes predictions\n",
    "3. transformer interface: converts data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can refer to the original `scikit-learn` API paper for more details: [Buitinck, Lars, et al. \"API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.0238 (2013).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the structure of `scikit-learn` needed to make these fits. `.fit` always takes two arguments:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  estimator.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will consider two estimators in this lab: `LinearRegression` and `KNeighborsRegressor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, `Xtrain` must be in the form of an *array of arrays*, with the inner arrays each corresponding to one sample, and whose elements correspond to the feature values for that sample (visuals coming in a moment).\n",
    "\n",
    "`ytrain` on the other hand is a simple array of responses.  These are continuous for regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](scikitlearn1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is very easy to use: Suppose you wanted to fit the following dataset with a particular regression estimator, for example the Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](scikitlearn2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, the predictor $x$ is along the $x$-axis, whereus the dependent variable $y$ is along the $y$-axis. The goal is simple: use the dataset to learn the model and then predict for new, unseen values of $x$. With the structure outlined above, this is very easy to code in sklearn:\n",

For example, if $v_1 = v_2 = v_3 = 1$, then  $X^T X$ is not invertible.  If $v_1 = v_2 = 1$ and $v_3 = 4$, then $X^T X$ is invertible.  You check this directly via the code below.  In the code we've used the determinant of $X^T X$ to check for invertibility.  That is, $X^T X$ is invertible if and only if $\\det(X^T X) \\ne 0$.  \n",

For the first example with $v_1 = v_2 = v_3 = 1$ we can see by inspection that $X$ is not invertible since the third column of $X$ is a constant multiple of the first column, ie, the  columns of $X$ do not form a linearly independent set.)*"
